This is an Tip Calculator application that demonstrate the usage of the simple IOS application. 

Time spent: 3 hours in total

Completed user stories:

1. Required: User can enter tips percentage in 10%, 20% and 30% from the selector
2. Required: application can calculate the total amount base on the user input.


Optional: (In progress)

1. Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After an extended period of time, clear the state. This is a UI trick that Apple uses with the Spotlight app. If you return there a minute later, it will show your most recent search. if you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank. To implement this, plug into the application lifecycle and track time using NSDate.

2. Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separators.
3. Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.
